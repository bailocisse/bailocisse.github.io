We will use a Docker image created by Confluent that installs all of the necessary Kafka components including, among others, the broker and ZooKeeper. Kafka allows us to store messages in topics, which are distributed across multiple brokers by splitting topics into data partitions that save us from unfortunate broker failures.\nTo get started with this project, we will begin with a simple Kafka implementation. With this implementation, we will create a Python application that publishes vehicle location longitude-latitude data to a Kafka topic. Next, we will use Node.js to start a web server that acts as a consumer for the messages received from the Kafka application.\nDownload and extract the Project 24_3_Kafka folder Text to show on mouseover Open your Docker Desktop. Select the gear icon on the top right of the Docker Desktop window, then select Resources. Ensure that your CPU and memory are both set to a minimum of 6 GB. For windows users : Inside your user home folder: C:\\Users\\‚ÄùYOUR_WINDOWS_USERNAME‚Äù, create a new file titled .wslconfig. Copy and and paste the following lines of code inside of the .wslconfig file: [wsl2] memory=8GB # Limits VM memory in WSL 2 processors=4 # Makes the WSL 2 VM use 4 virtual processors localhostForwarding=true # Boolean specifying if ports bound to wildcard or localhost in the WSL 2 VM should be connectable from the host via localhost:port. Text to show on mouseover Next, you will create the Kafka Docker container components. Navigate to the kafka-docker folder inside the Project24_3_Kafka folder. In a Terminal window, run the following command to initialize your Kafka container: docker-compose up Open the Docker Desktop and confirm that all of the required Kafka container components are now up and running. The nine required container components are: zookeeper, broker, schema-registry, rest-proxy, connect, ksqlbd-server, ksql-datagen, ksqlbd-cli, and control-center.\nText to show on mouseover Open your browser and navigate to the following URL: http://localhost:9021. This is the Confluent Control Center, and it will allow you to check the status of the Kafka cluster that you spun up. Text to show on mouseover Navigate to the Topics list on the Confluent Control Center by selecting ‚ÄúTopics‚Äù in the controlcenter.cluster in the Confluent Control Center. Text to show on mouseover Next, you will be writing Python code to simulate an IoT device that publishes the longitude and latitude coordinates of vehicles‚Äô locations to Kafka. From http://localhost:9021, select Topics and then select ‚ÄúAdd a topic‚Äù. Title the new topic vehicle-coordinates, set the number of partitions to 1, and select ‚ÄúCreate with default settings‚Äù. Text to show on mouseover From the command prompt, run the following command to install the Kafka Python client: pip install kafka-python Text to show on mouseover In VS Code, open the PublishVehicleCoordinates.py file inside the pythonProducer folder.

You can enable this feature by toggling the math option in your config/_default/params.yaml file.\nTo render inline or block math, wrap your LaTeX math with {{\u0026lt; math \u0026gt;}}$...${{\u0026lt; /math \u0026gt;}} or {{\u0026lt; math \u0026gt;}}$$...$${{\u0026lt; /math \u0026gt;}}, respectively.
